synopsis: Make fromSourceIO run in IO
prs: #1661

description: {

Some streaming abstractions, like io-streams, require stateful
initialization. Since all actual call sites of `fromSourceIO`
are in a context where `IO` actions can be executed, these
streaming sources can be accomodated by having letting
`fromSourceIO` run in `IO`.

To migrate your existing `FromSourceIO` instance, simply put
a `pure`/`return` in front of it.
